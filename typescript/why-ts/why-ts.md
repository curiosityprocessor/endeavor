## TypeScript enables *'types'* on objects
#### Benefits
1. know what kind of data is present in an object
2. prevent errors & typos when accessing objects
3. increased productivity with IDE-enabled content assists, auto-complete, etc

#### vanilla js VS TypeScript: data processing example
_vanilla js_  
1. receive certain data
2. run code on client to find what kind of data is received _e.g._ console.log(data)
3. return to coding unables to _see_ inside the object, prone to typos

_TypesScript_  
1. preassign _'types'_ to objects using js doc ```@typedef```
2. receive certain data
3. view how the object type is defined _within_ the code
